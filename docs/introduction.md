# Introduction to SLURM Dashboard

## Overview

The SLURM Dashboard is a powerful, user-friendly web application designed to provide comprehensive insights into the utilisation and performance of High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters managed by SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management). This tool aims to bridge the gap between raw SLURM data and actionable insights, enabling system administrators, researchers, and stakeholders to make informed decisions about resource allocation, usage patterns, and overall cluster efficiency.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the SLURM Dashboard is to transform complex SLURM accounting data into visually appealing, easy-to-understand metrics and graphs. By doing so, it addresses several key challenges faced by HPC administrators and users:

1. **Data Visualisation**: Converting raw SLURM data into intuitive charts and graphs, making it easier to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in cluster usage.

2. **Resource Optimisation**: Providing insights that help in optimising resource allocation, identifying underutilised resources, and improving overall cluster efficiency.

3. **User Behaviour Analysis**: Offering detailed statistics on individual and group usage patterns, helping to understand and optimise user behaviour.

4. **Performance Monitoring**: Enabling real-time and historical performance monitoring of the cluster, jobs, and users.

5. **Informed Decision Making**: Equipping administrators with the necessary information to make data-driven decisions about hardware upgrades, policy changes, and resource allocation strategies.

## Key Features

The SLURM Dashboard offers a range of features designed to provide comprehensive insights:

- **Data Upload**: Easy import of SLURM accounting data.
- **Date Range Selection**: Flexible time-based analysis.
- **Job Statistics**: Detailed metrics on job performance and resource usage.
- **User Statistics**: Insights into individual and group usage patterns.
- **Activity Heatmap**: Visual representation of cluster activity over time.
- **Data Export**: Capability to export processed data and visualisations.

## Target Audience

The SLURM Dashboard is designed to benefit a diverse range of users within the HPC community:

- **System Administrators**: For monitoring cluster health, optimising resource allocation, and planning future upgrades.
- **Researchers and End-Users**: To understand their usage patterns and optimise their job submissions.
- **Department Heads and Stakeholders**: For high-level insights into resource utilisation and return on investment.
- **Support Staff**: To assist in troubleshooting and user support.

## Conclusion

By providing a user-friendly interface to complex SLURM data, the SLURM Dashboard empowers the HPC community to make the most of their computational resources. Whether you're looking to optimise cluster performance, understand usage patterns, or make informed decisions about future investments, the SLURM Dashboard is an invaluable tool in your HPC toolkit.
